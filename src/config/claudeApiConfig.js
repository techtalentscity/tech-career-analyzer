    - Adjust weights based on missing constant variables (if 1 missing: 50/50, if 2 missing: 40/60, if 3+ missing: 20/80)
    - Note fallback logic application when less than 2 constant variables are present or key criteria missing
    - Rank recommendations by confidence score based on data completeness and algorithm performance
    - Ensure all three algorithms are analyzed even if data is incomplete
    - Focus the analysis on the highest-confidence algorithm while providing comprehensive coverage
    - Include specific Technical Specification v1.1 terminology and approach throughout

    Make the analysis highly technical and data-driven while remaining practical and actionable.
    The person should understand they've received a sophisticated algorithmic analysis using the 
    Multi-Tier Recommendation Engine with fallback logic and dynamic weighting.
